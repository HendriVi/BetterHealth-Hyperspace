<h1>Our method</h1>
<p>Most people are told they are healthy in the absence of a diagnosis. The problem is that diagnoses usually arrive after years of drift. We work upstream: measure early signals, make a clear plan, and prove that it is working with repeat data.</p>
<h2>Measure → Interpret → Intervene → Iterate</h2>
<p>We keep the process simple. We choose measurements that change decisions, interpret them in context (your symptoms, history, and constraints), act on the few levers that matter, and then re‑check to confirm direction.</p>
<h2>1) Pre‑Check</h2>
<p>A short intake (call or questionnaire) to clarify your goals, medical history, medications/supplements, lifestyle, and constraints. You receive a recommended diagnostic depth (Essential / Advanced / Elite) and a clear next‑step plan.</p>
<h2>2) Baseline Diagnostic Day</h2>
<p>Your baseline is where guessing stops. Depending on your needs, this may include targeted bloodwork and clinical measures, plus optional physiology tracking (e.g., sleep and recovery metrics). If advanced diagnostics are appropriate (brain‑focused testing or imaging via partners), we discuss it transparently—what it adds, what it costs, and what decisions it will change.</p>
<h2>3) Interpretation &amp; plan</h2>
<p>You get a plain‑language review: what is normal for you, what is trending the wrong way, what matters now, and what can wait. Then we translate this into a prioritized plan across nutrition, training, sleep, stress physiology, and supplements or medications where appropriate—always tied to measurable outcomes.</p>
<h2>4) 12‑week precision program</h2>
<p>Implementation is where most plans fail. Over 12 weeks, we help you execute the plan with structured check‑ins, data review, and adjustments. The goal is not perfection; it is direction and consistency that shows up in your markers and your day‑to‑day function.</p>
<h2>5) Membership follow‑up</h2>
<p>Healthspan is not a one‑off project. Membership keeps you on track with retesting cadences, plan iteration, and ongoing clinical oversight—so you do not slide back into “I’ll deal with it later.”</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Scope &amp; safety</h2>
<p>BetterHealth is designed for prevention, optimization, and long‑term risk reduction. We do not provide emergency care. If urgent symptoms are present, you should seek immediate medical attention. We coordinate with your treating clinicians when specialist care is required.</p>
